Designed to wait for tweets  mentioning @RasPiCam and then reply with a picture!

Currently checks for new tweets evey 30 seconds

Things to fix:
1. Currently only replies to the last tweet it got in the last 30 seconds
2. Only responds to tweets mentioning @RasPiCam first. i.e. "@raspicam take a picture"
